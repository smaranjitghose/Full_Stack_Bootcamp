   <h1>how to make Chicken curry</h1>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, red chili powder (if using), and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. <strong>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes,</strong> or up to overnight</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. <strong>>Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saut√© until softened and golden brown.</strong</li>
    <li>Stir in the turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and red chili powder (if using). <em>Cook for a minute or two, allowing the spices to release their aroma</em></li>
    <li>Add the tomato puree to the pot and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. <em>This will enhance the flavor and color of the curry.</em></li>
    <li>Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes,<em> or until the sauce thickens slightly.</em></li>
