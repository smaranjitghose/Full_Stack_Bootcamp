        Step-by-Step Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>Follow these steps carefully to bake your perfect chocolate cake:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round baking pans.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry mixture. Beat the mixture using a mixer for 2-3 minutes until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully pour the boiling water into the batter. Mix until it’s well combined. The batter will be thin, but don’t worry!
        </li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>Frost your cake with your favorite icing, and enjoy your 2nd-to-none chocolate cake!
