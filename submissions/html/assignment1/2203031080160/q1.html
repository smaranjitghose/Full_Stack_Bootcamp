    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <u>
        One of my favorite hobbies is drawing. It’s a relaxing way for me to express my creativity and unwind. Whether I’m sketching simple doodles or more detailed designs, drawing helps me focus and forget about everything else for a while. I love experimenting with different styles and materials, like pencils, charcoal, and ink.

    Drawing also allows me to improve my skills over time. Each new piece brings its own challenges, whether it’s getting proportions right or adding depth with shading. It’s a rewarding process to see an idea take shape on paper.
