    <h1>ALL about F1</h1>
        <p>Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international 
            racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération 
            Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been 
            one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950. 
            The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. 
            A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take 
            place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

    <h1>Racing</h1>
    <p>The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order 
        they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with 
        no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows 
        drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase 
        traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the 
        grid for the race start.</p>
