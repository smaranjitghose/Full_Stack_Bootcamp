    <h2>How to bake a cake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Crush graham crackers (or cookies or whatever your recipe uses) in a food processor 
            so they're finely and uniformly ground</em>. Next, mix the crumbs with butter, 
            following recipe directions.</li>
        <li>Pat the crust mixture into the bottom of a greased springform pan, covering the pan 
            seam and extending up the sides 1 to 2 inches. Use a straight-sided glass or measuring 
            cup to tamp the crust evenly against the pan. Aim for about 1/4 inch thickness for your crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust until it's fragrant and a shade darker, <strong> 10 minutes at 325Â°F</strong>, or according 
            to your recipe. Baking the crust sets it and keeps it from getting soggy or shifting when the 
            cheesecake batter is added. Let the crust cool completely.</li>
        <li>Before adding the cheesecake mixture, brush the top inside of the pan (above the crust line) 
            with butter to help keep any batter that rises above the crust from sticking to the pan.</li>
    </ol>
