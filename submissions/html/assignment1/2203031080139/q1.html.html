    <h1>MY FAVORITE HOBBY</h1>
        Watching series is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to immerse myself in different worlds and stories. Whether it’s a thrilling crime drama, a heartwarming comedy, or a mind-bending sci-fi, I love how each series takes me on a unique journey. The ability to watch multiple episodes at once gives me a sense of continuity, and I enjoy seeing how characters evolve over time.
