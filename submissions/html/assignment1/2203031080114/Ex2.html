     <h2>Steps for Making Mutter Paneer</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Gravy: Start by heating butter in a pan and saut√©ing chopped onions until they are translucent. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until fragrant. Then, incorporate ripe tomatoes and cashew nuts, cooking until the mixture is soft. Blend this mixture into a smooth puree for a rich gravy base</li>
        <li>Add Spices: Return the blended gravy to the pan and add spices such as red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and coriander powder. Stir well to combine and let it simmer, allowing the flavors to meld togethe</li>
        <li>Incorporate Paneer: Gently add cubed paneer to the simmering gravy. You can choose to fry the paneer lightly beforehand for added texture, but fresh paneer can be added directly. Ensure that the paneer is coated well with the gravy</li>
        <li>TFinish with Cream: To achieve a creamy <sup>texture,</sup> stir in heavy cream just before serving. This not only enhances the richness of the dish but also balances the spices. Garnish with kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and fresh coriander for added flavor</li>
