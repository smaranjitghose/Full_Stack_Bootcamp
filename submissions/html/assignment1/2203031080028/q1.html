    <h1>Coding</h1>
    <p>
        Coding is my favorite hobby because it allows me to create, solve problems, and continuously learn. 
        Writing code feels like building something out of nothing, where ideas turn into functional programs or applications.

        One of the things I love about coding is its versatility. Whether it's designing websites, building mobile apps, or solving algorithms, 
        there's always something new to explore. It challenges me to think logically and improve my skills every day.
